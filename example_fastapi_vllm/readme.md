## How to Use This Setup

1. Create the following directory structure:
```
project/
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── app/
│   ├── main.py
│   └── client.py
```

2. Build and run with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

3. Access the API:
   - FastAPI docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Health check: http://localhost:8000/health
   - Generate endpoint: http://localhost:8000/generate

## Key Benefits of Using FastAPI with vLLM

1. **Interactive Documentation**: FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI docs
2. **Type Safety**: Pydantic models ensure request validation
3. **High Performance**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks
4. **Easy Extensibility**: You can add authentication, monitoring, etc.
5. **Async Support**: Perfect for handling concurrent requests

You can further enhance this setup by adding:
- Authentication and API keys
- Rate limiting
- Request logging and monitoring
- Stream responses for real-time generation
- Additional endpoints for specific model capabilities

This setup provides a production-ready API service for your vLLM-based model inference.
