# ðŸš€ Train LLaMA2 with LoRA using `llama-factory`

This repository provides a simple setup for fine-tuning LLaMA2 models using LoRA via the `llama-factory` framework.

To begin, first set your Weights & Biases API key:

```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY=your_wandb_key
```

Then run the environment and dependency setup scripts:

```bash
bash setup1.sh
bash setup2.sh
```

Next, set your Hugging Face token to access the model:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=your_hf_token
```

Finally, start training:

```bash
bash train.sh
```

Training outputs, including model checkpoints and logs, will be saved to the `./outputs/` directory or the path specified in your configuration. Make sure `train.sh` is properly configured with your model path, dataset, LoRA/QLoRA settings, and training arguments.

Happy training! ðŸš€
